| 2.   | cargo build           | A command to build / compile the project and produce executables. It creates a directory called **target** when run for the first time in a project. You can also use the **rustc** command to compile your source code, like **rustc main.rs**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 5.   | Cargo.lock            | File used to maintain list of dependencies and their versions used in a project.<br/>Its generated by the **cargo build** command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 6.   | cargo check           | Command to verify that a project compiles without producing any executables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 7.   | cargo build --release | Command to produce release version of executables. By default cargo generates executables with debug information. Release executables are better optimized and don't have debug symbols or runtime safety checks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 8.   | mut                   | A keyword which tells the compiler that the data can be modified. You can modify data either using the variable or a reference to that variable but in each case you need to tell the compiler explicitly about your intent of modifying it.<br/><br/>Eg:<br/>let mut guess;  // declare a modifiable variable named **guess**.<br/>read_line(&mut guess) // the same variable being passed to a function called **read_line** which is expected to modify the value using a reference to the variable. |
| 9.   | the prelude           | Its a set of symbols Rust automatically brings into scope from the standard library which get used in almost every program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

##### rustc - rust cool or rust compiler :)

Rust compiler enumerates every single error it throws and you can find more details about those using the compiler itself.
Following is a snapshot of error mismatched types and the second last line tells you how you can find more details about it.

And following is what that explanation looks like -

Random

Scope

    use std::io; io::stdin()

    std::io::stdon()

    Both of the above ways are identical in Rust, they have no difference when it comes
    to binary size or any other build aspect.
    Unlike in C++, where using a namespace brings all its symbols into scope which
    essentially increases the binary size regardless if all the symbols are being used or
    not.
